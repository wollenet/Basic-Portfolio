        <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello world, my name is Ethan and I am a part time employee and student. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing from John Carroll University. I am currently working part-time at Huntington National Bank and am a part-time student at Case Western Reserve University enrolled in their coding boot camp. My interests when I am not at work or school involve running/training for half and full marathons, playing golf and snowboarding. Ultimately my goal is to one day be a full stack developer with the ability and knowhow to build impressive and professional websites and web application.</p>
